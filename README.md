# Transparent Educational Grant Management

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, efficient, and accountable management of educational grants from application to impact reporting.

## Overview

This decentralized application (dApp) transforms educational grant management by creating a transparent ecosystem connecting funders, educational institutions, and stakeholders. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures funding integrity, streamlines application processes, automates disbursements, and provides verifiable outcome tracking for educational initiatives.

- **Oracle Integration**: Chainlink for external educational data verification
- **Frontend**: React-based web application with institutional dashboards
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication with institutional verification
- **Analytics**: Integrated data visualization for outcome analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- Truffle or Hardhat for smart contract development
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Institutional credentials and documentation
- Educational accreditation information

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/educational-grant-management.git
cd educational-grant-management

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet
```

### Configuration

1. Register as a funder or applicant organization
2. Complete the verification process with required documentation
3. Configure grant parameters or application details
4. Set up notification preferences and reporting schedules
5. Connect institutional financial accounts for disbursement

## Use Cases

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core smart contract development and security auditing
- **Phase 2**: Web application development with institutional dashboards
- **Phase 3**: Integration with existing educational management systems
- **Phase 4**: Advanced analytics and outcome visualization tools
- **Phase 5**: Mobile application for field-based outcome documentation
- **Phase 6**: AI-powered grant matching and outcome prediction

## Security and Privacy Considerations

- Role-based access control for sensitive information
- Data encryption for confidential institutional details
- Student privacy protections (FERPA compliance)
- Secure credential management
- Third-party security audits
- Backup and disaster recovery protocols

## Implementation Challenges

- Varying regulatory requirements across educational jurisdictions
- Integration with legacy financial systems
- Standardization of outcome metrics across diverse educational contexts
- Digital divide considerations for under-resourced institutions
- Balancing transparency with appropriate privacy protections
